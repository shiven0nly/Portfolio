# Portfolio 😎 (After extracting just click on the *'portfolio.html'* file)

Welcome to my personal **Portfolio Website** repository!

This project showcases my journey as a budding developer and creative mind. It includes details about me, the projects I’ve worked on, and the skills I’m building.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This portfolio is still under development. I’m actively working on improving and updating it — new sections, animations, and design tweaks are coming soon!
> and sorry 'projects demos are 'static images' due to large size of video files it is not compatible so, but i provided the buttons, click on the button to get repo'
